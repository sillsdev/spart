Spart
=====

The Spart library is an object oriented recursive descent parser generator framework implemented in C#. In fact, it is a partial port of the excellent Spirit library, which is written in C++ and uses meta-programming.

It is based off of the [original work](http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/5676/Spart-a-parser-generator-framework-C) done by Jonathan de Halleux.
